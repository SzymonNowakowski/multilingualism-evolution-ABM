####### PLOTTING CODE #######


# This script contains the code to produce desired plots from the output of a series of simulation experiments about the effect different language choice rules for dyadic conversations on the generational trends in multilingualism. 
# Agents have rules specific to:
# A child speaking to their parent
# A parent speaking to their child
# All other interactions (all of which will be outside the nuclear family/household) 



##### What do we want to show here? ####
# -	For scenarios in which parents are required to speak L1 to their children but children are not required to speak L1 to their parents, how many parents in each generation are being forced to speak to their children in a language that they do not know well?
#   o	That is not their best known language
# o	In which they have a speaking ability value <50/100?
#   -	
#   
#   
#   
#   Output to track:
#   At the end of each generation, for all agents age 49 (the oldest age)
# -	Number of proficient speakers of each language
# -	Number of 50% speakers of each language?
#   -	Number of languages spoken by each person 
# 
# Across generations within a household
# -	Parent natal language and child speaking values in each of the three languages (at age 24? (the age right before children become parents)). 

# Read in the output of the model sweep.

### Function to create a line plot from model output - one plot for each scenario, saved in a list of ggplot objects

# plot_data = a list of data frames, each of which contains summary data from model output, ready for plotting
# x = name of the variable to plot on the x axis
# y = name of the variable to plot on the y axis
# split_by = name of the variable to map onto the color and fill arguments for ggplot (probably Language)
# labs_x, labs_y = character strings, specifying the axis labels for the plots. Defaults to x and y, but if these variable names aren't ideal for pretty plots, specify the preferred text here. 
# group = a character string, specifying the grouping variable. Defaults to 'Rep', the variable name that designates which model run the summary data belong to. This should have the effect of plotting a separate line for each language for each run of the model.

# -	It looks like ‘random consistent’ and ‘L1’ don’t actually matter because each of the languages has the same probability of being chosen as a parental language under these two scenarios. Except that under the random choice scenario, children seem to learn the prestige language slightly faster. Not sure why. Maybe this is stochastic variation b/c right now these are all single runs.

#### Experiments to Run ####

# Parameter Sweep on weighted probability of within-household interactions
# Parameter Sweep on adherence to Marriage Rules. 
# Marriage Rules: Right now they marry at random. 
# How do differences in mutual intelligibility affect outcomes?



#### Things to do ####

# Make a plot function for plotting child language trajectories grouped by parent speaking choices. 
# Make function: choose to speak language of highest speaking efficacy
# Make function: Marry based on language rules.
# Setup: Mutual Intelligibility Parameter. 
# Setup: Faster language acquisition for L3+ in children.
# Adjust Language Acqusition Rate for both speaking and understanding
# Add a Forgetting Option

# Make a 3-generation version of the model?



#### I think that's enough for today. 


# replace agent IDs with agent languages spoken.  <--- you already have code for this.
# tally up agent languages heard. <--- you already have code for this.
# tally up the languages spoken by each agent. because speaking only improves by speaking. 
# calculate agent improvements in language speaking
# calculate agent improvements in language understanding
